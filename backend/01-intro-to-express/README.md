## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
{CHALLENGE_FOLDER_NAME}/
├── starter/           # Where you write your solution
│   ├── setup.js       # Automatic setup script
│   ├── package.json   # Project config and scripts
├── solution/          # Maintainer's solution (revealed later)
└── README.md          # Challenge instructions (this file)
```

💡 **Pro Tip:** Each challenge includes a `starter/` folder where you'll build your solution.  
The `solution/` folder becomes visible **after the deadline** for learning purposes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18+)
- A code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- A terminal (Linux/macOS/Windows)

### ⚡ Lightning-Fast Setup

Inside the `starter/` folder, run my custom setup command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

🎉 **That's it!** My script handles package installation and dev server startup automatically.

This powerful script will:

- Install all dependencies
- Run any required initialization
- Start the local dev server (if applicable)

> 🔁 If you run into errors, try deleting `node_modules` and running the setup again.
