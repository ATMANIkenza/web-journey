## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18+) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- A code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Git for version control

### ⚡ Setup Instructions

Navigate to the challenge folder and follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the starter folder
cd {CHALLENGE_FOLDER_NAME}/starter

# 2. Install project dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 4. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
```

**What these commands do:**

- `npm install` - Downloads and installs all the packages your project needs
- `npm run dev` - Launches a development server with hot reloading (saves automatically refresh the page)

> 🔄 **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter errors, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.
