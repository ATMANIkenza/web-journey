## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🛠 Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18+)
- A code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- A terminal (Linux/macOS/Windows)

### ⚡ Lightning-Fast Setup

Inside the `starter/` folder, run my custom setup command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This powerful script will:

- Install all dependencies
- Run any required initialization
- Start the local dev server (if applicable)

> 🔁 If you run into errors, try deleting `node_modules` and running the setup again.
