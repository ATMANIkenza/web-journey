## 🏗️ Challenge Structure

All challenges contribute to building the **main project** located in the `project/` folder:

```bash
project/
├── frontend/     ← Frontend challenges build here
├── backend/      ← Backend challenges build here  
└── README.md     ← Project overview and setup
```

> 💡 **Key Concept:** Instead of isolated exercises, you're building one cohesive application that grows with each challenge!
