## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By following this guide, you'll master:

- 🍴 **Forking** repositories (making your own copy)
- 💻 **Cloning** code to your computer
- 🌿 **Creating branches** (like saving different versions)
- 🚀 **Pushing** your work to GitHub

## 🚀 The Complete Journey

### 📦 **Step 1: Get Your Own Copy (Fork)**

Think of this like **photocopying a book** so you can write in it without affecting the original.

1. **Look at the top-right** of this GitHub page
2. **Click the `Fork` button** 🍴
3. **Boom!** You now have your own copy under **your GitHub username**

> ✅ **You've just created your personal workspace!**

---

### 💻 **Step 2: Download to Your Computer (Clone)**

Now let's get your copy onto your computer so you can actually code!

**Open your terminal** and run these commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/web-challenges.git
cd web-challenges
```

> 🔄 **Replace `YOUR-USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username!

> ✅ **Perfect!** The code is now on your computer.

---

### 🌿 **Step 3: Create Your Work Branch**

Think of branches like **different notebooks** for different projects. Let's create yours!

**Choose the command that matches your challenge:**

```bash
# 🎨 Working on a frontend challenge?
git switch -c YOURNAME/frontend-challenge-01

# ⚡ Working on a backend challenge?
git switch -c YOURNAME/backend-challenge-01
```

> 🔄 **Replace `YOURNAME`** with your actual name (like `john/frontend-challenge-01`)

> ✅ **Awesome!** You're now working in your own safe space.

---

### 🛠 **Step 4: Set Up Your Challenge**

Time to get everything running! Navigate to your challenge folder:

**Example for frontend challenge 01:**

```bash
cd frontend/challenge-01/starter
```

**Then run the magic setup command:**

```bash
npm run setup
```

> 🎉 **Sit back and relax!** This installs everything you need and starts the development server.

> ✅ **Ready to code!** Your challenge environment is now running.

---

### 🧠 **Step 5: Show Your Skills (Solve)**

Here's where the fun begins!

**Two simple rules:**

- ✅ **Write all your code inside the `starter/` folder**
- ✅ **Test your solution** to make sure it works

> 💪 **Take your time!** There's no rush. Focus on learning and practicing.

---

### 💾 **Step 6: Save Your Progress (Commit)**

Finished coding? Let's save your work like a professional developer!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✅ Solved frontend challenge 01"
```

> 🎨 **Make your message meaningful!** Use descriptions like:
>
> - `"✅ Solved frontend challenge 01"`
> - `"🎯 Completed backend API challenge"`
> - `"🌟 Added responsive design to challenge 02"`

> ✅ **Excellent!** Your work is now saved with a clear description.

---

### 🚀 **Step 7: Upload to GitHub (Push)**

Time to send your solution back to GitHub!

```bash
git push origin YOURNAME/frontend-challenge-01
```

> 🔄 **Use the same branch name** you created in Step 3!

> ✅ **Amazing!** Your solution is now live on GitHub.

---

### 📬 **Step 8: Share Your Solution (Pull Request)**

The final step - let's share your awesome work with the community!

1. **Go to your fork** on GitHub (in your browser)
2. **Look for the yellow banner** with "Compare & pull request" button
3. **Click that button** 🔘
4. **Make sure the Pull Request is set up correctly:**
   - **From:** `YOUR-USERNAME/web-challenges` (your branch)
   - **To:** `Adel2411/web-challenges` (main branch)
5. **Add a clear title** like:
   - `Frontend challenge 01 - Adel`
   - `Backend API challenge - Sarah`
6. **Click "Create pull request"** 📤

> 🎯 **Important:** Your Pull Request should go from **your fork** to the **original repository's main branch**!

> 🎉 **CONGRATULATIONS!** You've just made your first contribution like a real developer!

---

### 🔄 **Step 9: Stay Updated (Sync Fork)**

After workshops, I'll add new challenges! Here's how to get them in your fork:

**Method 1: Using GitHub Website (Easiest)**

1. **Go to your fork** on GitHub
2. **Look for "Sync fork"** button (usually shows "X commits behind")
3. **Click "Sync fork"** → **"Update branch"**
4. **Pull changes to your computer:**

```bash
git switch main
git pull origin main
```

**Method 2: Using Terminal (More Advanced way)**

```bash
# Add the original repo as upstream (only do this once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Adel2411/web-challenges.git

# Switch to main branch
git switch main

# Get latest changes
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

> 🎯 **When to sync:** Before starting each new challenge!

> ✅ **Perfect!** You now have all the latest challenges.
